It's [programming] the only job I can think of where I get to be both an engineer and
an artist. There's an incredible, rigorous, technical element to it, which I like
because you have to do very precise thinking. On the other hand, it has a wildly
creative side where the boundaries of imagination are the only real limitation.

Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be
a violent psychopath who knows where you live.
